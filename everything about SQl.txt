SQL COMMANDS

1. create table

CREATE TABLE products (
id INT NOT NULL,  // not null means this field is not to be null.
name STRING,
  price MONEY,
  PRIMARY KEY (ID) //way to create the primary key.
)

2. insert data into colomns

INSERT into products (when we want to insert into all colomns)
VALUES(2,"copy", 2.54)

INSERT INTO products(id, name) (when we have to insert data in the particular colomns or not fill in any of the colomn)
VALUES(3,"chips")

3.read data from TABLE
SELECT * FROM products //by which we can see whole table

SELECT * FROM products WHERE id=1 // if we want to select or read any rows

SELECT name, price FROM products // if we want to ignore any of the colomn.

UPDATE products // update table name
set price=10 // which value
